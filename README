fbkutils: Linux kernel utilities from Facebook

NOTE: this repo is no longer updated

================================================================================

ncrx:		A library for processing extended netconsole messages from the
		Linux kernel. See Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt in the
		kernel source for details about extended netconsole.
		Moved to https://github.com/facebook/netconsd

netconsd:	A daemon which uses libncrx to receive and process netconsole
		messages from a large number of remote hosts. We use this daemon
		for collecting kernel logs from all the servers at Facebook.
		Moved to https://github.com/facebook/netconsd

netesto:	NEtwork TESting TOls, a set of tools for network testing. It
		allows one machine, the controller, to run network load tests
		currently consisting of many netperf transfers. The controller
		is in charge of controlling the clients (which run netperf) and
		servers (which run netserver) and collecting the results. I've
		used this framework extensively in the past year to evaluate
		TCP-NV and compare various TCP variants such as cubic, nv, bbr,
		etc.
